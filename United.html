                      During the Microsoft Design Challenge 22, I took on the task of addressing accessibility challenges for Acid Attack Survivors (AAS). Throughout a two-week period, my primary focus was on designing an navigation app Called "UNITED". The goal of this app was to assist AAS individuals in finding nearby AAS-friendly locations. My aim was to create a solution that is user-friendly, empowering, and promotes inclusivity for the AAS community.

            <p style="font-size:20px; margin:1rem">
              In the Microsoft Design Challenge 22, I identified a pressing issue faced by Acid Attack Survivors (AAS) - the lack of accessible services and locations tailored to their needs. To tackle this problem, I conceptualized UNITED, a software application designed to empower AAS individuals in finding nearby AAS-friendly locations. With a duration of two weeks, my aim is to create a user-friendly solution that allows AAS individuals to easily locate essential services such as hospitals, rehabilitation centers, support groups, counseling services, and beauty salons from their current location. Through this project, I strive to enhance inclusivity, promote accessibility, and provide a supportive platform for the AAS community.

<p style="color:#28282b; font-size:20px; margin:1rem">
  I have designed a storyboard for the United application, aiming to enhance understanding and communication. It visually represents the user experience, maps the user journey, and identifies areas for improvement.

<span style="font-weight: 500; color:#000000; font-size: 25px;">Wireframes</span>

<p style="color:#28282b; font-size:20px; margin:1rem">
  Due to time constraints, I was unable to design the entire United App. However, I have made progress by focusing on the user onboarding section, homepage section and developing wireframes for that specific area. These wireframes depict the planned structure and layout of the user-onboarding & location section, allowing for a better understanding of its features and functionality. Please note that the wireframes for other sections of the app are still a work in progress.

  The UI screens for United App showcase the final visual design, incorporating colors, typography, and imagery for a user-friendly experience. They cover different aspects of the application and ensure consistency and clarity. These screens bridge the gap between wireframes and implementation.  It is important to note that due to time constraints, the entire app has not been designed. However, significant progress has been made with the development of the user onboarding and homepage section, for which the corresponding UI screens have been listed.
